An Östermalm favourite spot - with Östermalm prices of course. An inspiring place with shelves filled with both boxes of plant based lunch and kitchen supplies for foodies like us. The founder Renee Voltaire is a green entrepreneur in the health food 2.0 business. Quality crispy fresh food so good that it makes your body smile (and your wallet cry). Almost everything is vegan! A favorite is the kelp noodle salad. Crispy cashew and tasty tamarind!
