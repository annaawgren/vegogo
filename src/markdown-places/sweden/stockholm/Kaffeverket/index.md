Located at the busy corner of Sankt Eriksgatan and Torsgatan you find stylish and super fresh Kaffeverket. If you like tiles and to look at trendy vasastanians this is a place for you. There is not too many vegan options, but the ones they have is super fresh and yummy. Like breakfast-all-day-overnight oats. And avo kimchi salad. Lattes and cappuccinos with plant based milk cost 5 sek extra though, so prepare for pricy.

It's worth it though, when you can have it in style!
