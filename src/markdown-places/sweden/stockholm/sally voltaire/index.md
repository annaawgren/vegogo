This talented chef grew up in the restaurant business. She's into colorful greens, raw food and being true to the ingredients. Green is a way to live! There is salad and there is Sally's salad... It's hard to be disappointed here. Seasonally chosen greens, perfectly cooked beans, lemon, ginger and nuts are often spotted on Sally's plates. We also love the sustainable kitchenware that's for sale here.
