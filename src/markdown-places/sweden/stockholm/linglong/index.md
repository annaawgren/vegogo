An asian fusion cuisine again – why can't get enough of you?

Ling Long was the name of a Chinese women's magazine published in Shanghai 1931–1937. Now it's a popular restaurant and bar at the Story Hotel. Eclectic, urban atmosphere and their backyard is where to be during summer. Rub your eyes, because there are eight delicate dishes on the 110 % vegan and mouth-watering lunch menu. Salads, steamed buns, wok and daal. How many days have a week? Ling long is King (Kong)!
