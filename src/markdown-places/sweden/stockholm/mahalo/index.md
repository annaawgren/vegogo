My my. At Malaho, on Hornsgatan just round the corner from Rosenlundsgatan, you find food for mouth – and eyes. It’s hard to find any other place that has this color explosion for an – all vegan – menu.

Choose between a Pitaya, Acai, Spirulina or Salina smoothie bowl with Tiki, Loco or Yogi topping. Or have a more full meal like say Buddha Bowl with tofu or tempeh and sweet potato, or a soy burger with vegan bacon and sweet potato fries. OR try vegogo favorite Luaua Bowl with a spicy raw walnut and sunflower seed mince – taste like taco but so much better!

There are so many options at Mahalo. The restaurant is just like the food, very colorful and tilltalande and as long as the weather allows, you can sit outside on gårdshus terrace. Don’t miss.
